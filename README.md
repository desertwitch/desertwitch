Starting **18.08.2024** you can verify my commits and any signed release packages for authenticity using PGP/GPG.

You can import my [PGP/GPG key](desertwitch.gpg) directly from public keyservers or GitHub, otherwise download it using its fingerprint.

Direct Import from Public Keyservers: `gpg --recv-keys FDE5DBCF17924276532BFBCADDA4D1A906FD918F`

Direct Import from GitHub: `gpg --fetch-keys https://raw.githubusercontent.com/desertwitch/desertwitch/main/desertwitch.gpg`

Fingerprint: `FDE5 DBCF 1792 4276 532B FBCA DDA4 D1A9 06FD 918F` (e.g. https://keys.openpgp.org or https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/)

My public key also includes my e-mail, should you need to contact me, which is not listed elsewhere for anti-spam reasons.

Commits should now show as "**Verified**" on GitHub, any unsigned commits from after this date should be treated with caution.
